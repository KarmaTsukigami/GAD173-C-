How to Play: 
Your objective is to bounce the ball off the paddle and try to destroy all of the bricks at the top of the screen.
If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, you will lose a life. You lose if all lives are lost.

Controls: 
Left and right keys to move the paddle. Mouse to click the buttons.

Level Editor: 
For the level editor, click 'Set' and you will be prompted to add an integer into the console. To use these settings, click the 'Load' button after to play with those settings.

Note: I recommend keeping the number of rows to 4 or less, it may become too difficult otherwise, as well as less than 8 columns.
